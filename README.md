`sceptre` is an R package for single-cell CRISPR screen analysis.
`sceptre` infers gene-perturbation associations by modeling the random
assortment of CRISPR guide RNAs among cells instead of modeling gene
expression, thereby remaining valid despite confounder presence and
arbitrary misspecification of the gene expression model.
