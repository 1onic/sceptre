# `sceptre`: robustly infer regulatory relationships in single-cell CRISPR screens <img src="man/figures/hex.jpg" align="right" alt="" width="180" />

`sceptre` is an R package for single-cell CRISPR screen analysis. `sceptre` infers gene-perturbation associations by modeling the random assortment of CRISPR guide RNAs among cells instead of modeling gene expression, thereby remaining valid despite confounder presence and arbitrary misspecification of the gene expression model.

# Installation

Install the package from Github via the following command:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("timothy-barry/sceptre")
```
