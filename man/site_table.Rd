\section{Overview}{

This object is part of the example data in the \code{sceptre} package. The data are taken from the paper "Global Analysis of Enhancer Targets Reveals Convergent Enhancer-Driven Regulatory Modules" by Xie et al., 2019. The authors used a CRISPRi-based perturb-seq assay to target >500 putative enhancers in a population of K562 cells. The example data consist of a subset of the sequenced gRNAs and genes measured on 106,660 cells.
